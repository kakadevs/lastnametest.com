        unassuming man who has become so powerful that he can defeat any opponent with a single punch. Despite his

        of
        not being recognized as a true hero. He joins the Hero Association to find more challenging enemies and to give
        his
        life purpose, but his nonchalant attitude and plain appearance often lead others to underestimate him. The
